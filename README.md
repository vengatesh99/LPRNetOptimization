# LPRNetOptimization
Environment Setup and Testing: Download the .ipynb file and run the cells sequentially in Google Colab. 
## Note: Since we have used Tensorrt optimization, it would require a GPU. Please connect to the T4 GPU runtime provided by colab for Tensorrt alone. Other measurements and techniques are available in CPU itself
