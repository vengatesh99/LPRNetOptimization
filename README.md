# LPRNetOptimization
Environment Setup and Testing: Download the .ipynb file and run the cells sequentially in Google Colab.
#### Note: Since we have used Tensorrt optimization, it would require a GPU. Please connect to the T4 GPU runtime provided by colab while executing Tensorrt optimization. Other techniques can be executed in CPU itself
